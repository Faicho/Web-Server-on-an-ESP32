# Web-Server-on-an-ESP32
Creating and hosting a web server off of an ESP32. I am using this project to learn more about the networking in general and specifically with the ESP32.
I installed a MicroPython interpreter on the ESP32 and I used the Pymakr VS Code extension to access files, run them, access the ESP32's REPL etc. Does not work on non-local networks yet.
